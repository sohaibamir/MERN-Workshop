First rename your react folder to frontend
Create a new folder outside the frontend folder and name it backend

Run the following command inside backend folder
npm i nodemon mongoose morgan express body-parser cors dotenv

Make .env file inside backend folder and create these two variables
DATABASE='mongodb+srv://sohaib:sohaib123456@cluster0.afvnwpy.mongodb.net/mern-workshop'
PORT=8000

Add this line in your package.json file 
"scripts": {
   "start": "nodemon src/index.js"
}

we're setting up a Node.js server using Express and integrating various middleware like mongoose, body-parser, cors, morgan, and dotenv for environment variables. Here's a brief overview of what each of these does:

Express: A web application framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution for modeling application data.
Body-parser: Middleware used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under req.body.
Cors: Middleware used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain.
Morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, used to log requests to the server for debugging.
Dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
